# COVID19-by-nation-webapp
<Br/>
This web application provides a comprehensive overview of novel coronavirus data from various countries in real-time, leveraging the CDC API to deliver up-to-date information. Initially developed in March 2020 as part of a data visualization assignment during my university studies, the application integrates with the Leaflet API to effectively display and visualize COVID-19 data on interactive maps.<Br/>
<Br/>
Resources used: USCDC API, BCCDC Data,  WHO Data, Leaflet API

As of April 2024, this project no longer supports real-time data reports from the CDC API and is now only displaying historical data.
