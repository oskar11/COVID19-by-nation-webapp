# COVID19-by-nation-webapp
<Br/>
A very simple web application that returns results of the novel coronavirus data from each country specified by the user. Data for the original project was collected from covid-19-apis.postman.com through the APIs listed in the documentation. The leaflet API is used to visually display the coordinates of each country, along with cases.<Br/>

This webapp was originally created as a term project for my CSC course<Br/>
